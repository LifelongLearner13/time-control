# Time Control
Tired of having to change the time filter every time you start a new search? Time control is the solution. Built on top of Google's built-in time filtering options, this Chrome&trade; extension will persist your preferences across multiple Google searches.

## Usage
With time control you have two main options for filtering your Google searches, select one of six presets or define your own time interval. When you've made your selection hit *enter* or *Submit*. The search page will automatically reload with your filter in effect. The filter will be applied to all subsequent Google searches. You can alter the time filter via the Google search *Tool* menu; however, that filter will only apply to the current search.

Note: the extension is only available on Google search pages.
